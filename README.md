# 👋 Hi! I'm Sam Neale.

> Building thoughtful software, one small system at a time.

I’m a developer based in Australia with a focus on **clean web apps**, **good UI**, and **tools that solve real problems**.
Most of my work sits at the intersection of **React, TypeScript, Node**, and careful design.

---

## What I’m working on

- 🧩 **Practical web tools** — things I actually want to use
- 🧠 Learning how to design systems that scale _without_ getting bloated
- 🎨 UI that feels calm, intentional, and human
- 📷 **Captured** — my photography side project

You can see more context (and fewer GitHub stats) on my site:
